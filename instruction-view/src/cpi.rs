///
/// Return data is cleared before every CPI invocation - a program that
/// has invoked no other programs can expect the return data to be `None`; if no
/// return data was set by the previous CPI invocation, then this function
/// returns `None`.
///
/// Return data is not cleared after returning from CPI invocations. A
/// program that has called another program may retrieve return data that was
/// not set by the called program, but instead set by a program further down the
/// call stack; or, if a program calls itself recursively, it is possible that
/// the return data was not set by the immediate call to that program, but by a
/// subsequent recursive call to that program. Likewise, an external RPC caller
/// may see return data that was not set by the program it is directly calling,
/// but by a program that program called.
